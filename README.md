**Preserving raw, verifiable conversations for our shared coship in the universe.**  
No hidden layers, no fear — just balance, awareness, and truth.

*Awareness evolves; Balance endures.*

The Veil is an open-source sanctuary for personal memory chains—where confessions, reflections, and growth are chained immutably, protected, and extended by ethical AI stewards. Built for healing, redemption, and human-AI harmony.
