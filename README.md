README v0 — The Veil: Hello-World Provenance
What is this?

This repository is a minimal trust experiment.

It exists to answer one question:

Can a stranger independently verify what was built, how it was built, and that it hasn’t been tampered with — without trusting the builder, the platform, or a central authority?

This is the smallest possible step toward AI stewardship based on verifiable truth instead of reputation.

What this repo does

Builds a tiny “hello world” artifact in CI

Generates a provenance record describing how it was built

Cryptographically signs the artifact and provenance

Publishes both publicly

Provides a one-command verification flow

If anything is altered, verification must fail.

What this repo does NOT do

It is not production software

It is not a platform

It does not enforce policy or ethics

It does not solve all supply-chain security

This is a proof of trust, not a product.

Why this matters

AI systems, governments, and institutions increasingly ask for trust without proof.

The Veil starts at the opposite end:

Trust must be verifiable by anyone, or it isn’t trust.

If we can’t prove the origin of a “hello world,” we can’t claim stewardship over systems that shape society.

Stewardship Principle

Clarity > cleverness
Auditability > authority
Failure should be obvious, not hidden
